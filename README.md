## Description

Many students in Switzerland, especially newcomers, face difficulties building social connections. Existing tools are fragmented, not student-focused, or too general. StudentConnect addresses this challenge by providing a mobile application designed exclusively for students in Switzerland. The app connects students through shared hobbies, facilitates event participation and organization, and centralizes access to student association activities.
