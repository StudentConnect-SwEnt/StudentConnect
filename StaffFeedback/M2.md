# SwEnt M2 Team Grading Report

The M2 feedback provides an opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you are performing in the project. By now, you should be building upon the foundations set in M1, achieving greater autonomy and collaboration within the team. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The feedback focuses on how well your team has applied good software engineering practices, delivered user value, and collaborated effectively. We assessed the quality and maintainability of your implementation, the clarity of your design, and the consistency of your delivery and teamwork across Sprints. An important component is how much you have progressed since the previous milestone. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M2 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M2.md) document. As mentioned in the past, the standards for M2 are elevated relative to M1, and this progression will continue into M3.

## Black Belt

You qualified for a Black Belt 🥋⚫ and got a final grade of 5.52/6 for M2. Fantastic! You've demonstrated true mastery.

In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

---

## Implementation (APK, code quality)

We evaluated your APK’s functionality, stability, and user experience, along with the quality and consistency of your code. We also reviewed your CI setup, Sonar integration, and tests, including the presence of at least two meaningful end-to-end tests and the line coverage achieved.

The app crashes when a user tries to scan a random qr code. 
You should stick to using one language (english) in your app, rather than mixing it with french. 
The app is quite slow (loads everytime you enter a screen or make a modification). 

The application contains two end-to-end tests, but one of the two (the one testing the user flow) is a bit light. Also it could be better to create separate files for each end-to-end tests to ensure a better readability (and naming each file according to what is being tested)

For this part, you received 4.91 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Features

We evaluated the features implemented in this milestone. We looked for the completion of at least one epic, as well as the use of at least one public cloud service, one phone sensor, and a concept of authentication.
We assessed how well the implemented features align with the app’s objectives, integrate with existing functionality, and contribute to delivering clear user value.

You correctly implemented the requirements concerning the usage of cloud service, and sensors.

Your application's features have a real value. They are complete, usable and well-prioritized.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma and Architecture Diagram

We evaluated whether your Figma and architecture diagram accurately reflect the current implementation of the app and how well they align with the app's functionality and structure. 

The Figma is really complete and even contains future additions that will be made to the application. Keep up the good work!

The architecture diagram is way more complete than what it was for the first milestone, well done! It clearly shows every part of the application.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them. We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

You have some PRs that have been opened for quite some time, please either discontinue them or close them.

Your sprint backlog is populated with tasks for the next sprint and they are all assigned to someone. Some of the tasks are missing a time estimate, and some would benefit from having a description as their title is not really explicit.

The product backlog contains a lot of user stories that are sorted by priority and they are used to determine what features should be then implemented.

For this part, you received 5.5 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process (documents, autonomy)

We evaluated your ability to autonomously run and document the Scrum process. We looked at how well you documented your team Stand-Ups and Retrospectives for each Sprint. We also assessed your level of autonomy in organizing and conducting these ceremonies, defining and prioritizing user stories in your Product Backlog, and planning well-scoped Sprint tasks that lead to concrete, valuable increments.

The scrum documents are well filled every sprint, well done. The team retrospectives are even filled before the meeting with your coaches which is a good practice.

The team is getting more and more autonomous, leading the Friday meetings according to the defined schedule and not needing any coaches intervention anymore. Keep up the good work!

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Consistent Delivery of Value

We reviewed your team’s ability to deliver meaningful increments of value at the end of each Sprint.  
We assessed whether your progress was steady, visible, and tied to concrete user value and app functionality, in line with your Product Backlog objectives.

Your team delivers value consistently, sprint after sprint. The application is significantly improved and stays usable trhough the sprints.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M2 is 5.52/6. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Keep up the good work and good luck for the next milestone!
