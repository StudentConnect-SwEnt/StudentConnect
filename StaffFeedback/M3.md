# SwEnt M3 Team Grading Report

This M3 milestone is the culmination of your SwEnt journey, and it gives us the final opportunity to give you, as a team, formal feedback on how you performed in the project. By now, you should be capable of demonstrating a solid command of the Scrum methodology and collaborative teamwork, and be able to deliver a high-quality application that is ready for real users.
This feedback report is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback that you received from your coaches during the weekly meetings, over email, on Discord, etc.

You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M3 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M3.md) document.
As mentioned before, the standards for M2 were elevated relative to M1, and this progression continued into M3: we now hold you to the highest professional standard in SwEnt.

## Completeness

We first evaluated the depth and complexity of the main epics in your app, along with their contribution to the app, the tangible value they provide to the user, and their alignment with the app’s goals.

We evaluated the extent to which your app meets the course requirements articulated at the start of the semester, and whether they are implemented effectively, they integrate seamlessly, and are indeed essential to the app.

We also looked at the robustness and completeness of the different features you implemented: are all the features finished and polished, are they secure and bug-free, and are they thoughtfully designed.

The app presents a well-rounded and convincing final product. The main epics are clearly implemented with good depth, and the overall features are complete and coherent. Core functionality is present and works as expected, giving a strong sense of a finished application.

The use of cloud services and authentication is meaningful and well integrated. Sensor usage is included in a way that supports the app’s value rather than feeling artificial. Offline support is also handled well, with a smooth experience when transitioning between offline and online usage.

Most features are fully implemented, with only minor gaps or edge cases remaining. The app benefits greatly from being populated with real content, which makes the intended user experience and final vision very clear.

Overall, this is a strong and complete product. With a bit more refinement in smaller details, it would reach an even higher level of polish.

For this part, you received 5.7/6.

## Functionality

In this context, we assessed your app's ability to handle unexpected inputs provided by clueless or malicious users (including spamming buttons, entering wrong inputs, stopping a process mid-way, etc.); we wanted to see that your app handles all edge cases gracefully, has comprehensive error handling, and includes robust mechanisms for maintaining stability under stress.

We then evaluated the performance and reliability of the final product, i.e., the APK: we wanted to see that your APK is stable and the UI responds quickly and has seamless navigation.

Next we looked into your implementation of user authentication and multi-user support: does the app correctly manage users, can users personalize their accounts, does the app support session persistence, are multi-user interactions well supported, can accounts be used on another device, and is account information preserved when switching devices.

The app demonstrates very strong technical depth. Core flows work reliably end-to-end, and the implemented features go beyond basic requirements in terms of complexity and ambition. Interactions feel stable, and the app handles navigation and user actions robustly, even under less structured usage.

Data persistence is mostly solid, with information remaining consistent across sessions. One notable issue appears in the login/logout flow: after logging out and signing in with a different account, some user data (such as the profile) can still reflect the previous session. While this does not affect most flows, it is noticeable in a final product.

This is a technically strong and well-engineered application. The functionality feels mature and thoughtfully implemented, reflecting a high level of technical understanding and execution

For this part, you received 5.57/6.

## User Experience

For this part, we wanted to see how intuitive and user-friendly the app is for real users. Beyond having good usability, did you pay attention to streamlining the interactions, is it easy to figure out, can new users start making good use of the app quickly, are the interaction flows well thought out and refined.

The app feels well thought through and mature. Navigation is clear overall, and once inside the app, it’s easy to understand where things live and how different parts connect.

Visually, the app is consistent and pleasant to use. While some layouts could benefit from improvement in some rare cases, the overall experience feels coherent and intentional. First-time users are not left guessing what to do.

The features come well together: they feel meaningful, technically substantial, and well integrated into the experience. Interactions are smooth, the app feels responsive, and the overall polish is clearly there.

For this part, you received 5.5/6.

## Design and Maintainability

We evaluated whether your code is of high quality and employs best practices.
We expect the codebase to be polished, well documented, follow consistent conventions, be modular, and allow for easy modifications.
You should be able to employ advanced techniques by now, such as asynchronous functions (flows, coroutines), good resource management, and automated dependency injection (e.g., with Hilt).

We also assessed your overall app architecture and design, looking in particular at aspects surrounding robustness and scalability.
We looked at both the codebase and the documentation of the app (Wiki and architecture diagram), we expect your design to demonstrate thoughtful consideration for performance, maintainability, and future growth.

The architecture is pretty solid and should be scalable.

The repository is well orgamised and the code is clean and readable while being well structured.

For this part, you received 5.7/6.

---

## QA (Testing)

The first aspect we looked at here was your test suite, in terms of both quality and the final line coverage.
We expect the testing to be rigorous and to cover all components and edge cases, and they should validate every significant user journey.
Your end-to-end tests should be detailed and include error-handling scenarios.
The tests should be well-documented and easy to maintain.
Finally, your test suite should demonstrate advanced techniques, mock data for performance testing, and automated regression tests.

The continuous integration pipeline runs on pull requests, ensuring that the project is automatically validated and that regressions are detected early.

Sonar is integrated into the repository, providing visibility into code quality issues and helping maintain a high standard of reliability.

For this part, you received 5.72/6.

---

## Documentation

We looked at your README and GitHub Wiki to evaluate the quality and completeness of your app’s documentation. We expect the README and Wiki to be thorough and achieve professional-level clarity and completeness.
They should provide detailed descriptions of the app's architecture, implementation of the features, the development setup and guidelines for contributing.

We also assessed your use of Figma and the architecture diagram for effective UI design, organization, and app structure planning.
By this stage, we expect your Figma and Architecture diagram to be complete and up-to-date. The Figma should be consistent with the UI and the Architecture diagram should be comprehensive.

Additional developer-oriented documentation is provided, such as CONTRIBUTING guidelines, module-level documentation, or API usage notes. This supplementary material improves maintainability and helps new contributors understand and work with the codebase more effectively.

The ReadMe and the Wiki are really complete, well done!

The Figma is really complete and contains a working prototype that is helpful to understand the expected flows in the application.

The architecture diagram is also complete, clean and true to the application.

Overall the code is well documented, making it easy for someone to understand what is implemented and how it is done.

For this part, you received 5.85/6.

## Autonomy

A primary goal of SwEnt is to teach you how to function autonomously as a team.
For this part of the evaluation, we assessed you team’s independence, spanning Sprint 6 to Sprint 10, based on the meetings with coaches, Sprint planning, and how you managed risk.
By this stage, coaches should no longer be necessary for the team to operate, i.e., you can organize yourselves, you don't need to be reminded about tasks, and you can conduct the Scrum ceremonies on your own.

The team demonstrated autonomy during meetings, structuring discussions effectively and consistently following the Scrum ceremony process without needing significant coach intervention.

The team maintained a respectful, constructive, and professional tone in meetings and discussions, contributing positively to collaboration and team cohesion.

For this part, you received 6/6.
